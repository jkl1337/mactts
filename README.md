mactts
======

mactts is a small Golang wrapper for the Mac OSX Speech Synthesis Manager Carbon API.
This is originally created for the production of TTS speech server demo. While newer versions of Mac OSX ship with the same typical Nuance VocalizerÂ® there is no matching the utility of the original MacInTalk Pro voices. And when you need them and don't have a real Mac handy, what is one to do?

TODO
====
- Finish the server implementation
- Web frontend API
